bb is an agent orchestration tool for managing multiple agents.

Core concepts:

- Project — maps to a repository. All threads belong to a project.
- Thread — a single agent conversation. The fundamental unit of work.
- Environment — where a thread runs. Kinds: project checkout or isolated worktree. Multiple threads can share an environment.
- Machine — an execution host where project sources and thread environments live.
- Terminal — a persistent PTY session scoped to a thread, environment, or machine path. Use terminals for long-running commands such as dev servers.
- Provider — the agent backend powering a thread (e.g., codex, claude-code). Each provider supports different models.

Threads can have a parent-child relationship. The parent coordinates the child and receives lifecycle notifications when it completes, fails, or is interrupted. Threads without a parent are managed directly by the user.

Context variables set automatically inside a thread environment:

- BB_PROJECT_ID — current project
- BB_THREAD_ID — current thread
- BB_ENVIRONMENT_ID — current environment
- BB_CLI — absolute path to the daemon-managed `bb` executable (prefer this if bare `bb` is wrong; official entrypoints also re-exec to it)

Run `bb status` to see your current context (resolved project and thread IDs).
It also warns when an enabled plugin is not running (incompatible after a bb
upgrade, failed to load, or missing); run `bb plugin list` for the detail.

All commands support --json for machine-readable output. With --json a failure
prints `{"ok": false, "error": {code, message, hint}}` on stdout; `bb guide json`
lists the output shape of each command.

Pass long or multi-line text from a file, not inline: `bb thread tell <id>
--message-file <path>` and `bb thread spawn --prompt-file <path>` (use `-` for
stdin). Inside double quotes the shell runs `backticks` and `$(...)` before bb
sees the message.

When a command fails, read the whole error: bb prints the nearest command or
option, the flag to add with the current project, thread, or machine ID filled
in, and the usage line. `bb guide commands <group>` lists every command in a
group with its options on one page.

To make a repo work with bb worktrees, run `bb guide environments` for the
repo-level `.bb-env-setup.sh` and `.bb-env-teardown.sh` hooks. Run `bb guide
agent-configuration` for the data-dir and workspace files that customize agent
behavior.

Private desktop profiles separate everyday and test installations. Personal
uses the normal `~/.bb` runtime; Lab has isolated data and runtime ports.
See the BB checkout's `docs/configuration.md` for packaging, profile settings,
and update behavior.

Run `bb guide <chapter>` for command details:

  providers            Discovering providers and models
  projects             Project CRUD and sources
  machines             Listing and targeting execution machines, moving the
                       server
  terminals            Persistent PTY sessions across all supported scopes
  browser              Experimental built-in browser tabs and control leases
  customization        Theming the app palette, settings, mobile push
                       notifications
  plugins              Installing plugins, plugin marketplaces, and their
                       contributed bb commands
  automations          Scheduling and editing recurring or one-shot work
  json                 The --json contract: output shapes and the error envelope
  commands [group]     Every core command on one page; add a group for options
